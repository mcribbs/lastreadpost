# NOTICE: Due to Ars moving forum software to phpBB which has last read functionality built in, this project is pretty much dead dead dead. #

Thanks all.


This is a modification of THBMans excellent LastReadPost greasemonkey script, updated to store the read status on a central server for use on multiple machines. It’s quick and dirty and hasn’t been tested much, but so far seems to work. You’ll need a server with php and mySQL to use this.

[Setup instructions](Setup.md)

FYI: I just added the ability to hide posts which have been read as discussed [here](http://episteme.arstechnica.com/groupee/forums/a/tpc/f/34709834/m/251002384831/p/1/r/350008484831#350008484831).  It's only in the server version and is controllable via the hideread var. It only hides posts on the more recent page, as I figure if you're looking at previous pages in the post, you're looking for something.  It's kinda nifty, but I don't know how useful it is.  I also hacked it in pretty quick, so there are likely bugs.  I let my sub lapse so I can't respond in that thread, but there you go. --kitzke
